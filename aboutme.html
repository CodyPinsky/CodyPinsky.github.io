    <h1>About Cody</h1>
    <p>My name is Cody Pinsky. Im a sophomore at URI pursuing a major in marine biology and a minor in computer science. I am from Syracuse NY and have quite a few hobbies listed below. What you would not guess from me is that I would rather stay home and be relaxing to a good show or playing a fun game. More what nobody knows about me is I have a blue stripe in my left eye and I overcame a speech issue at such a young age. These last two things is what makes me special.</p>
